# Doctrine ORM with Zend Framedwork and ZFDebug

This is a proof of concept to have Doctrine data in a ZFDebug panel. My Doctrine plugin for ZFDebug is at:
  
    library/Danceric/Controller/Plugin/Debug/Plugin/Doctrine.php 

To try this demo project, you need to put these libs in the `library` folder (or in your php include path)

- [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) 1.9.x
- [ZFDebug](http://code.google.com/p/zfdebug/) 1.5.x
- [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) 1.2.x

It should look like:

    library/
      Danceric/
      Doctrine/
      ZFDebug/
      Zend/

If you use the sqlite database, make sure that it is readable/writable by the web server
